                    <h1>1<sup>st</sup> Generation of Computers</h1><br>
                    <p>The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and 
                        circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of 
                        heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. In this generation, mainly batch processing 
                        operating system was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape was used as input and 
                        output devices and used machine code as the programming language.

                    <p>In this generation transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in 
                        size, more reliable and faster than the first-generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this 
                        generation, magnetic cores were used as primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as 
                        secondary storage devices. In this generation assembly language and high-level programming 
                        languages like FORTRAN, COBOL were used. The computers used batch processing and multiprogramming 
                        operating system.

                    <p>
                        The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. 
                        A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. 
                        The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and 
                        efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multiprogramming operating system 
                        were used. High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were 
                        used during this generation.

                    <p>
                        Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. 
                        VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with their associated 
                        circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation. Fourth 
                        generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable. As a result, it 
                        gave rise to Personal Computer (PC) revolution. In this generation, time-sharing, real-time 
                        networks, distributed operating system were used. All the high-level languages like C, C++, 
                        DBASE etc., were used in this generation.

                    <p>The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date. In the fifth generation, VLSI 
                        (Very large-scale integration)  technology became ULSI (Ultra Large-Scale Integration) 
                        technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic 
                        components. This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI 
                        (Artificial Intelligence) software. AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which 
                        interprets the means and method of making computers think like human beings. All the high-level 
                        languages like C and C++, Java, .Net etc., are used in this generation.
